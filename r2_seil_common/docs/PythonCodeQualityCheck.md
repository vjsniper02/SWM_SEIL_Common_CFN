# Python Code Quality Check
We will check Python code quality for AWS Lambda and Glue jobs. Black, Bandit and Safety packages are used to check 

## Formatting with Black
Black format the Python codes with pycodestyle against some of the style conventions in PEP8. 

## Security Check Python Code with Bandit
Bandit is used to find common security issues in the Lambda and Glue Python code. 
The configuration file used is integreation/bandit.yaml. 

Currently it runs all the default tests except skipping assert in test cases. 

The default configuration file (integration/bandit-default.yaml) can be generated by bandit-config-generator tool in bandit.

## Dependency Check with Safety
Safety checks the installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. By default it uses the open Python vulnerability database Safety DB.

From the integration/python-code-check.sh script, all packages listed in Poetry pyproject.toml and requirements.txt files are checked.

Currently the following packages are added for checking. In production, only the used packages will be added to check.

   - python = "3.9"
   - scikit-learn = "^1.0.2"
   - numpy = "^1.22.2"
   - scipy = "^1.8.0"
   - pandas = "^1.4.0"
   - matplotlib = "^3.5.1"
   - boto3 = "^1.20.49"
   - pyarrow = "^7.0.0"
   - flask = "^2.0.2"
   - requests = "^2.27.1"

Numpy has a security ID 44715 which is ignored in the script.
